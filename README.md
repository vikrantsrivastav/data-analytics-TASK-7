# data-analytics-TASK-7

ðŸ”¹ Objective

The original task was about pulling sales summary using Python + SQLite.
Here, I completed the same task using Microsoft Excel to show how basic sales data can be analyzed and visualized without coding.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed
1. Dataset Creation

Created a dataset named sales_data with the following columns:

Product

Quantity

Price

Added a calculated column:

Revenue = Quantity Ã— Price

2. Data Summarization

Used PivotTable to summarize the data.

Grouped by Product to calculate:

Total Quantity Sold (SUM of Quantity)

Total Revenue (SUM of Revenue)

3. Visualization

Inserted a Bar Chart from the PivotTable to visualize Revenue by Product.

This gives a clear view of which products contribute most to sales.

ðŸ”¹ Output

PivotTable showing product-wise sales summary.

Bar Chart showing product-wise revenue distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes

Learned how to use Excel for data summarization.

Practiced using PivotTables for grouping and aggregation.

Created a simple sales visualization using Excel charts.
